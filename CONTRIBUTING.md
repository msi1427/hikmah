# How to Contribute?

This repo is not aimed to contain anything that are explicitly implemented in different libraries. Things that are preferred in this repo are:

- Handling unstable and erroneous implementations in different libraries (if possible also contribute to their main repos).
- Implementing a faster and more robust version of what already exists. (An empirical explanation should be provided)
- There are ML and math concepts which are theoretical but does not have a good implementation. Those things can be added.
- Things that can be automated but have not yet been considered by others.
- --- To be continued ---
